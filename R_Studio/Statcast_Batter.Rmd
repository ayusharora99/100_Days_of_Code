This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)
install.packages('psych')
library(psych)
```

```{r}
statcast = read.csv('batters_statcast.csv')
fangraphs = read.csv('batters_fangraphs.csv')
```

```{r}
colnames(statcast)
colnames(fangraphs)
```
Match on Full Name:
```{r}
statcast["Name"] = paste(statcast$first_name,statcast$last_name)
fangraphs$Name = as.character(fangraphs$Name)
fangraphs$Name = str_trim(fangraphs$Name, side = c("both", "left", "right"))
statcast$Name = as.character(statcast$Name)
statcast$Name = str_trim(statcast$Name, side = c("both", "left", "right"))
typeof(statcast$Name)
typeof(fangraphs$Name)


full = merge(statcast,fangraphs, by = "Name")

```

r correlation analysis with each stat against wRC+ 
```{r}
drop = c("last_name","first_name","year","Team","X")
full = full[,!(names(full) %in% drop)]

nums = unlist(lapply(full, is.numeric))
full_nums = full[,nums]

corr = data.frame("Stat" = names(full_nums))
                    
for(i in 1:93){
  corr[i,"r"] = (cor(full_nums[i],full_nums$wRC.))
}

write.csv(corr, "batter_corr.csv")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
