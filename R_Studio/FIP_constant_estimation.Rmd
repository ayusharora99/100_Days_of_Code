This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
fip_constants <- read_csv("fip_constants.csv")

# 162 games * 30 teams estimation
LgERA = sum(fip_constants$R) / 4860

LgHR = sum(fip_constants$HR)

LgBB = sum(fip_constants$BB)

LgHBP = sum(fip_constants$HBP)

LgK = sum(fip_constants$SO)

# 162 games * 30 teams * 9 innings estimation
LgIP = 43740

# FIP Constant estimation for 2019
cFIP = (LgERA) - (((13*LgHR) + (3*(LgBB + LgHBP)) - (2*LgK))/ LgIP)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
