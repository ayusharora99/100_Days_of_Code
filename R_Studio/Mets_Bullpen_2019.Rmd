This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Import 
```{r}
mets = read.csv('mets_bullpen_2019.csv')

summary(mets)

colnames(mets)
```
Right/Left Split
```{r}
mets_RHH = mets %>%
  filter(stand == "R")

mets_LHH = mets %>%
  filter(stand == "L")


```

```{r}
mets_RHH_outs = mets_RHH %>%
  filter(events != c("single","double","triple", "home_run"))
mets_RHH_outs['events'] = "Out"

# Filter by singles, doubles, triples
mets_RHH_base_hits = mets_RHH %>%
  filter(events == c("single", "double", "triple"))
mets_RHH_base_hits['events'] = 'Base Hit'

# Filter by homeruns
mets_RHH_homeruns = mets_RHH %>%
  filter(events == c("home_run"))
mets_RHH_homeruns['events'] = "Home Run"

mets_RHH = rbind(mets_RHH_outs, mets_RHH_base_hits, mets_RHH_homeruns)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
