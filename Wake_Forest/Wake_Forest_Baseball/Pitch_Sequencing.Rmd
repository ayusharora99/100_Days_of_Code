library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
Wake = read.csv('Wake4Ayush.csv')

```

WHOLE DATASET:

```{r}
for( i in 1:(nrow(Wake)-1)){
  Wake[i+1,'previous_pitch_spin_axis'] = Wake[(i),'SpinAxis'] 
}
```

BY PITCHER NAME:

```{r}
Wake_TB = Wake %>%
  filter(Pitcher == 'Teller, Brent')

for( i in 1:(nrow(Wake_TB)-1)){
  Wake_TB[i+1,'previous_pitch_spin_axis'] = Wake_TB[(i),'SpinAxis'] 
}
```
