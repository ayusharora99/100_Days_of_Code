This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
Wake4Ayush <- read.csv("~/Documents/100_Days_of_Code/100_Days_of_Code/Wake_Forest/Wake_Forest_Baseball/Wake4Ayush.csv")
```
Filter by outs vs hits
```{r}
summary(Wake4Ayush$HitSpinRate)
unique(Wake4Ayush$PlayResult)

Wake4Ayush_Base_Hits = Wake4Ayush %>%
  filter(PlayResult == c("Single", "Double", "Triple"))

Wake4Ayush_HRs = Wake4Ayush %>%
  filter(PlayResult == "HomeRun")

Wake4Ayush_Flyballs = Wake4Ayush %>%
  filter(Distance >= 200)

Wake4Ayush_Base_Hits['Result'] = 1
Wake4Ayush_HRs['Result'] = 2
Wake4Ayush['Result'] = 0

Wake4Ayush = rbind(Wake4Ayush_Base_Hits,Wake4Ayush_HRs,Wake4Ayush)

Wake4Ayush$

Correlation between HitSpinRate and Base Hit / Home Run
```{r}
scatter_spinrate = ggplot(Wake4Ayush_Flyballs, aes(x = HitSpinRate, y = Distance )) +
  geom_point()

scatter_spinrate

Wake4Ayush_Flyballs_imp  = Wake4Ayush_Flyballs %>%
  select(Distance, HitSpinRate, LaunchAngle)


```

```{r}
correlation_coeff_p = cor.test(Wake4Ayush_Flyballs$HitSpinRate, Wake4Ayush_Flyballs$Distance, method = "pearson", conf.level = 0.95)
correlation_coeff_k = cor.test(Wake4Ayush_Flyballs$HitSpinRate, Wake4Ayush_Flyballs$Distance, method = "kendall", conf.level = 0.95)
correlation_coeff_s = cor.test(Wake4Ayush_Flyballs$HitSpinRate, Wake4Ayush_Flyballs$Distance, method = "spearman", conf.level = 0.95)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
